# studiolo
STUDIOLO is a prototype studio management system meant to assist artists, their affiliated studios, and their estates in defining their legacy and oeuvre by documenting their careers. The current version supports an exhibition history module that manages relationships between artists, artworks, art professionals, collections, exhibitions, and venues. In its final form, STUDIOLO would include modules for archives, conservation, intellectual property rights, multimedia, and provenance as a cross-platform, open-source application with a low barrier to entry.
